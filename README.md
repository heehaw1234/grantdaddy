# Team GrantMatch AI

Our team is dedicated to empowering non-profits and researchers by bridging the gap between brilliant initiatives and the funding they need. By leveraging advanced AI, we aim to democratize access to grants and streamline the often complex application process.

## AI-Powered Grant Discovery & Application Assistant
**"Intelligent funding matching made simple: Organizations find their perfect grants with semantic search, receive instant 'fit' analysis, and generate tailored application drafts—all powered by state-of-the-art LLMs."**

## Inspiration
GrantMatch was inspired by the struggle many small organizations face: spending countless hours searching for funding only to apply for grants they are unlikely to win. 

We realized that the problem wasn't a lack of grants, but a lack of **alignment**. We built GrantMatch to solve the "matching problem" specifically—moving beyond keyword search to true semantic understanding of an organization's mission and a grant's intent.

## Features

### For Grant Seekers (Organizations):

#### Smart Dashboard
*   **NLP Semantic Search:** deeply understands queries like "funding for youth mental health in rural areas" rather than just matching keywords.
*   **Profile-Integrated Matching:**
    *   **"Apply Profile Preferences" Toggle:** Seamlessly blends your organization's bio, mission, and location into search results.
    *   Manual filters (Issue Area, Scope, Funding) automatically refine AI search results for precision control.
*   **AI Match Scores:** Every grant gets a percentage score (0-100%) indicating how well it fits your specific organization.

#### Deep Fit Analysis
*   **Instant reasoning:** See exactly *why* a grant matches (e.g., "Aligned with your focus on Healthcare" or "Matches your geographic scope").
*   **"Find Out More" Dialog:** A comprehensive view showing:
    *   Match Breakdown (Issue Area, Funding, Scope).
    *   Detailed "Why You're a Good Fit" analysis generated by AI.
    *   Key requirements and deadlines.

#### Application Assistance
*   **Automated Write-ups:** One-click generation of a "Why we are a good fit" narrative.
*   **Custom Instructions:** Refine the AI's output by adding specific instructions (e.g., "Focus on our recent pilot program") before generating.
*   **Export Options:** Download analysis as text files for easier sharing and editing.

#### Smart Alerts System
*   **AI Email Notifications:** Runs nightly to find new grants that match your profile using the same powerful Groq AI model.
*   **Personalized Digests:** Emails include the match score and specific reasons for the fit, not just a link.

### For Admins / System:
#### Grant Management
*   **Database Integration:** Seamless sync with Supabase for grant storage and retrieval.
*   **Edge Functions:** Serverless functions handle the heavy lifting of scheduled email alerts and secure AI processing.

## How we built it
We utilized a modern, high-performance stack to ensure speed and accuracy:

*   **Frontend:** React & TypeScript for a type-safe, responsive UI.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & Shadcn/UI for a clean, professional aesthetic (Glassmorphism effects, crisp typography).
*   **Backend / Database:** Supabase for real-time data, authentication, and vector-ready database capabilities.
*   **AI / LLM:** **Groq API** (Llama-3.3-70b) for lightning-fast semantic analysis and text generation. We chose Groq for its incredibly low latency, making the "real-time" search feel instantaneous.
*   **Infrastructure:** Supabase Edge Functions for running scheduled AI tasks (like the email alert system).

## Challenges we ran into
*   **Balancing AI vs. Manual Control:** It was tricky to integrate the "Profile Preferences" logic with manual filters. We had to ensure that when a user toggled their preferences, it didn't just override their manual choices but enhanced them.
*   **Search latency:** Doing real-time AI scoring on large datasets is slow. We optimized this by implementing a hybrid approach—filtering candidates first, then applying the expensive AI scoring only to the most relevant matches.
*   **State Persistence:** Ensuring a seamless user experience meant persisting complex filter states and preference toggles across page reloads using LocalStorage and React Context.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
*   **The "Hybrid" Filter System:** Successfully created a system where users can layer manual constraints (e.g., "Must be >$50k") ON TOP of semantic AI searches, giving the best of both worlds.
*   **High-Fidelity AI Mails:** The email alert system doesn't just spam links; it actually "reads" the grants and sends a personalized explanation of why it fits the user.
*   **Zero-Friction Write-ups:** The write-up generation dialog allows users to go from "discovery" to "first draft" in under 10 seconds.

## What we learned
*   **Context is King:** The quality of the AI match improved dramatically when we started injecting the full Organization Profile (Mission, History) into the prompt, rather than just using the user's search keywords.
*   **UX Complexity of Filters:** "Simple" checkboxes often hide complex logic transparency issues. Adding detailed toasts and console logs helped us (and will help users) understand exactly *why* certain results are appearing.

## What's next for GrantMatch AI
*   **Full Application Generation:** Moving beyond the "Fit Analysis" to generating full responses for specific questions (e.g., "Describe your budget").
*   **Success Prediction:** Using historical data to predict the *probability* of winning a grant, not just the semantic fit.
*   **Multi-User Teams:** Allowing multiple members of an NGO to collaborate on a single grant pipeline.
*   **Integration with Gov Grants:** API integration with government databases for real-time syncing of public sector opportunities.
